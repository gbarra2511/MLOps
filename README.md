**how it was made**

This project taght me how to deploy a machine learning model that i created using a house pricing databse from kaggle,note that the model is not that complex because it was not the purpose of this project, it can predict a house price with attributes like year, size, number of garage spots... I've learned how to create a virtual enviroment(venv) and to manage packages versions using an (pip freeze > requirements.txt). How API works aswell, how to make requests, posts... how to use endpoints and app.routes in flask. Other important thing was the basicauth for authentication for making an request with authentication. 

Part of the project was develloped in google colab - mostly on vscode - and jupyter notebook.

for me I don't think that's relevant to commit the jupyter notebook and colab because the vscode is the main part.
